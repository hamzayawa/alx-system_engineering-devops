# 0x0C. Web Server

### Concepts
For this project, we expect you to look at this concept:

* What is a Child Process?

In this project, some of the tasks will be graded on 2 aspects:

1. Is your web-01 server configured according to requirements
2. Does your answer file contain a Bash script that automatically performs commands to configure an Ubuntu machine to fit requirements (meaning without any human intervention)

For example, if I need to create a file /tmp/test containing the string hello world and modify the configuration of Nginx to listen on port 8080 instead of 80, I can use emacs on my server to create the file and to modify the Nginx configuration file /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/default.
